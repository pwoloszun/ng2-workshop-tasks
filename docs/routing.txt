Feature style guide:
- xxx-yyy.module.ts file
- xxx-yyy-routing.module.ts file

Child routing:
  Each feature area resides in its own folder.
  Each feature has its own Angular feature module.
  Each area has its own area "shell" component.
  Each area shell component has its own router outlet and child routes.
  Feature area routes rarely (if ever) cross with routes of other features.

Routing params:
- prefer a required route parameter when the value is mandatory
- prefer an optional parameter when the value is optional, complex, and/or multivariate.

Relative Navigation:
The router supports directory-like syntax in a link parameters list to help guide route name lookup:
- './' is relative to the current level
- '../' to go up one level in the route path

Example:
this.router.navigate(['../../'], {relativeTo: this.activatedRoute});


Async routing (modules lazy loading):
  You can load feature areas only when requested by the user.
  You can speed up load time for users that only visit certain areas of the application.
  You can continue expanding lazy loaded feature areas without increasing the size of the initial load bundle.
