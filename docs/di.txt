DI:
- all providers from ALL eagerly loaded modules are globally registered(in AppModules injector) and available everywhere
- all providers from EACH lazy loaded module are registered and available only in that module(and its "children")

Good practices:
- CoreModule should be a "pure services" module - it should have only providers
- all "global" services should be moved to that CoreModule and imported only once in AppModule
- feature specific services should be registered in that feature top most component of that feature (usually entry/shell component)
- if you need new instance of service injected each time: define it at component level
